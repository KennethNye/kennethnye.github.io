## Preliminaries and Notation

In discrete time, let's say frame, each target is generally described at
frame $k \geq 1$ by a vector $\mathbf{x}(k)\mathbf{\in}\mathbb{R}^{n}$
of $n$ state variables representing its coordinates and characteristic
features.

The sequence of states from frame $1$ to $k$ is denoted by
$\mathbf{x}^{k} = \lbrace \mathbf{x}(t) \rbrace_{t = 1\cdots k}$. In particular $\mathbf{x}_{j}^{k}$ is the sequence of (estimated) states associated with the $j$-th track.

The state of target depends on the previous states through the state
evolution equation
$\mathbf{x}(k + 1) = f_{k}\left( \mathbf{x}^{k} \right) + \mathbf{w}(k + 1)$,
where the vector $\mathbf{w}(k + 1) \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a random and
additive noise at frame $k + 1$, while the vector-valued function
$f_{k}$ characterized the deterministic part of the evolution from
states $\mathbf{x}^{k}$ to $\mathbf{x}(k + 1)$.

The current measurement at frame $k$ is related to the state through the
measurement equation
$\mathbf{z}(k) = h_{k}\left( \mathbf{x}(k) \right) + \mathbf{v}(k)$,
where $h_{k}:\mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$ links the
measured features to the state variables while the noise
$\mathbf{v}(k) \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ is a random counterpart modelling
uncontrolled fluctuations of the measurement process. In particular,
$\mathbf{z}_{j}(k)$ represents the $j$-th observed measurement at frame
$k$.

The sequence of measurements associated with state sequence is
$\mathbf{z}^{k} = \lbrace \mathbf{z}(t) \rbrace_{t = 1 \dots k}$. In
particular, $\mathbf{z}_j^k$ is the sequence of measurements for the
$j$-th track. An example of a track up to frame $k - 1$ is shown as
$\mathbf{z}_1^{k - 1} = \lbrace \cdots\,\mathbf{z}_{2}(k - 1)\,\mathbf{z}_{3}(k - 4),\mathbf{z}_{1}(k - 3)\,\mathbf{z}_{3}(k - 2)\,\mathbf{z}_{1}(k - 1)\rbrace$ in Fig. 1.

In MTT, a tracking hypothesis up to time $k$ is defined as a set of $m$
tracks $\Theta^{k} = \lbrace \theta_{j}^{k} \rbrace_{j = 1,\cdots,m}$,
each one consisting of some sequence of measurements and estimated
states:
$\theta_{j}^{k} = \lbrace \mathbf{z}_{j}^{k},\mathbf{x}_{j}^{k} \rbrace $.
The putative extensions of each track from frame $k$ to $k + d$ are
represented by trees of association with measurements. As shown in Fig.
1, there are 5 possible extension tracks $\mathbf{z}_{1}^{k + 1}$ of
the track $\mathbf{z}_{1}^{k - 1} = \{\cdots,\mathbf{z}_{2}(k - 1),\mathbf{z}_{3}(k - 4),\mathbf{z}_{1}(k - 3),\mathbf{z}_{3}(k - 2),\mathbf{z}_{1}(k - 1)\}$
between frame $k$ and frame $k + 1$, which are listed as leaves. Notice
that virtual detections can also be incorporated to cope for missing
detections. The set of global tracking hypotheses up to frame $k + d$
when $\Theta^{k - 1}$ is fixed, denoted by
$\Omega_{\Theta^{k - 1}}^{k:k + d}$ can be obtained by combining these
independent trees.

## A Bayesian Model for Particle Tracking in Clutter

MTT aims to provide an accurate description of the conditional
probability

$$\mathcal{L}\left( \Theta^{K} \right) = P\left( \Theta^{K} \middle| Z^{K} \right)$$

that relates a candidate set of tracks $\Theta^{K}$ to the set of
measurements
$Z^{K} = \lbrace \lbrace \mathbf{z}_{j}(k) \rbrace_{j = 1,\cdots,n_{k}} \rbrace_{k = 1,\cdots,K}$where
$n_{k}$ is the number of observed measurements in $k$-th frame and $K$
is the total number of frames.

Based on the assumption that tracks in dependent, the conditional
probability can be written as

$$\mathcal{L}\left( \Theta^{K} \right) \propto \prod_{k = 1,\cdots,K}^{}{p\left( Z_{0}(k) \right)}\prod_{\theta_{j}^{K} \in \Theta^{K}}^{}{p\left( \mathbf{x}_{j}^{K},\mathbf{z}_{j}^{K} \right)}$$

where $Z_{0}(k)$ is the set of detections that remain non-associated at
frame $k$, i.e.
$Z_{0}(k) = \lbrace \mathbf{x} \in \lbrace \mathbf{x}_{i}(k) \rbrace_{i = 1,\cdots,n_{k}}:\mathbf{x} \notin \bigcup_{j = 1,\cdots,K}^{}\mathbf{x}_{j}^{K} \rbrace$.

### Embedded Target Existence Model

Let's focus on a particular track $j$ and drop the subscript $j$.
Denoting
$\chi^{k} \triangleq p\left( \mathbf{x}_{j}^{k},\mathbf{z}_{j}^{k} \right)$,
let's derive its expression. First, we define an additional variable
called the perceivability of a target. A particle is perceivable (state
$s^{1}$) if it can be detected while it is non-perceivable (state
$s^{0}$) if it physically does not exist anymore or cannot be detected
in images (e.g., fluorescence extinction, degradation). The
perceivability state sequence is modeled as a first-order Markov chain
with fixed transition probability $\pi_{ji}$ between from state $i$ to
state $j$. Denote the perceivability at frame $k$ as $s^{i}(k)$, then
the Markov assumptions yields
$p\left( s^{i}(k) \right) = \sum_{j \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace}^{}{\pi_{ji}p\left( s^{j}(k - 1) \right)}$.
Incorporating the perceivability, we have

$$\ \chi^{k} = p\left( \mathbf{x}_{j}^{k},\mathbf{z}_{j}^{k} \right) = \sum_{i \in \{ 0,1\}}^{}{p\left( \mathbf{x}_{j}^{k},\mathbf{z}_{j}^{k},s^{i}(k) \right)}$$

We further factorized the track joint probability, we reach equation
(A1)

$$\chi^{k} = p\left( \mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)\sum_{i \in \{ 0,1\}}^{}{p\left( s^{i}(k)|\mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)p\left( \mathbf{x}(k),\mathbf{z}(k)|s^{i}(k),\ \mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)}$$

$$= \chi^{k - 1}\sum_{i \in \{ 0,1\}}^{}{\lambda^{i}\left( k \middle| k - 1 \right)\xi^{i}(k)}$$

where
$\lambda^{i}\left( k \middle| k - 1 \right) \triangleq p\left( s^{i}(k)|\mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)$
and
$\xi^{i}(k) = p\left( \mathbf{x}(k),\mathbf{z}(k)|s^{i}(k),\ \mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)$.

Conditioning on $s^{i}(k - 1)$, we reach equation (A2)

$$\lambda^{i}\left( k \middle| k - 1 \right) = \sum_{j = \{ 0,1\}}^{}{p\left( s^{i}(k)|s^{j}(k - 1),\mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)p\left( s^{j}(k - 1)|\mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)}$$

$$= \sum_{j = \{ 0,1\}}^{}{p\left( s^{i}(k)|s^{j}(k - 1) \right)p\left( s^{j}(k - 1)|\mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)}$$

$$= \sum_{j = \{ 0,1\}}^{}{\pi_{ji}\lambda^{j}\left( k - 1 \middle| k - 1 \right)}$$

Using Bayer's rule, we reach equation (A3)

$$\lambda^{j}\left( k - 1 \middle| k - 1 \right) = p\left( s^{j}(k - 1)|\mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)$$

$$= \frac{p\left( s^{j}(k - 1),\mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)}{p\left( \mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)}$$

$$= \frac{p\left( \mathbf{x}^{k - 2},\mathbf{z}^{k - 2} \right)p\left( s^{j}(k - 1)|,\ \mathbf{x}^{k - 2},\mathbf{z}^{k - 2} \right)p\left( \mathbf{x}(k - 1),\mathbf{z}(k - 1)|s^{j}(k - 1),\ \mathbf{x}^{k - 2},\mathbf{z}^{k - 2} \right)}{p\left( \mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)}$$

$$= \frac{\chi^{k - 2}\xi^{j}(k - 1)}{\chi^{k - 1}}\lambda^{j}\left( k - 1 \middle| k - 2 \right)$$

The sequential process to estimate $\chi^{k}$ is cyclic A2-A1-A3 and the
algorithm is shown below:

### Measurement and State Joint Probability

Let's look at $\xi^{i}(k)$ when $i = 1$ and factor it by further
conditioning on $\mathbf{x}(k)$

$$\xi^{1}(k) = p\left( \mathbf{x}(k),\mathbf{z}(k)|s^{1}(k),\ \mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)$$

$$= p\left( \mathbf{z}(k)|s^{1}(k),\ \mathbf{x}^{k},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)p\left( \mathbf{x}(k)|s^{1}(k),\ \mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)$$

$$= \left\{ \begin{array}{r}
P_{D}P_{G}g\left( \mathbf{z}(k)|\ \mathbf{x}^{k},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)f\left( \mathbf{x}(k)|\mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right),\ if\ \mathbf{z}(k)\ is\ real \\
1 - P_{D}P_{G},\ otherwise \\
\end{array} \right.\ $$

where
$p\left( \mathbf{z}(k)|s^{1}(k),\ \mathbf{x}^{k},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right) = P_{D}P_{G}g\left( \mathbf{z}(k)|\ \mathbf{x}^{k},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)$
and
$f\left( \mathbf{x}(k)|\mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right) \triangleq p\left( \mathbf{x}(k)|s^{1}(k),\ \mathbf{x}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^{k - 1} \right)$
when the measurement is real.

When $i = 0$,

$$\xi^{0}(k) = \left\\{ \begin{array}{r}
P_{FD}(\mathbf{z}(k),k),\ \textrm{if}\ \mathbf{z}(k)\ \textrm{is}\ \textrm{real} \\
1,\ \textrm{otherwise} \\
\end{array} \right.\ $$

where the set of false detections has been approximately by independent
events, i.e.,
$p\left( Z_{0}(t) \right) = \prod_{\mathbf{z} \in Z_{0}(t)}^{}{P_{FD}(\mathbf{z},t)}$.

### Perceivability Chain Settings

The initial probability of Perceivability is set according to the
formula below:

$$\lambda^{0}\left( k \middle| k \right) = \frac{P_{FD}(\mathbf{z},k)}{P_{FD}\left( \mathbf{z},k \right) + P_{NT}(\mathbf{z},k)}$$

$$\lambda^{1}\left( k \middle| k \right) = \frac{P_{NT}(\mathbf{z},k)}{P_{FD}\left( \mathbf{z},k \right) + P_{NT}(\mathbf{z},k)}$$

where $P_{FD}(\mathbf{z},k)$ represents the probability of generating a
false detection while $P_{NT}(\mathbf{z},k)$ represents the probability
of generating a new target at frame $k$.

Once these two values are defined, the first state and measurement
probability
$\chi^{k} = \sum_{i \in \{ 0,1\}}^{}{\xi^{i}(k)\lambda^{i}(k|k)}$. These
are supplied to the algorithm as the requirements.

The state transition parameters are set as

$$\pi_{01} = 0$$

$$\pi_{00} = 1$$

$$\pi_{10} = \frac{1}{l_{m}}$$

$$\pi_{11} = 1 - \frac{1}{l_{m}}$$

on the assumption that non-perceivable target has $0$ probability to
switch to perceivable and the probability of perceivable target
switching to non-perceivable with an average number of frames $l_{m}$.

## Large Scale Multi-Frame Tracking

We aim at building the set of tracks

$$\Theta^{\star K} = \arg{\max_{\Theta^{K} \in \Omega^{K}}{\mathcal{L(}\Theta^{K})}}$$

however, the optimization $\mathcal{L}\left( \Theta^{K} \right)$ over
the whole solution space $\Omega^{K}$ is not feasible option when $K$
gets large. Instead, we adopt a sequential approach such that given
$\Theta^{\star k - 1}$, MHT solves an optimization problem that accounts
for $d$ future frames:

$$\Theta^{\star k + d} = \arg{\max_{\Theta^{k + d} \in \Omega_{\Theta^{\star k - 1}}^{k + d}}{\mathcal{L(}\Theta^{k + d})}}$$

Denote
$\Gamma_{j}^{k} = \lbrace \theta_{j,\mathbf{z}_{i}}^{k} \rbrace_{i = 1,\cdots,n_{k}}$
the set of tracks formed by potential association of
$\theta_{j}^{k - 1} \in \Theta^{\star k - 1}$ at frame $k$. In
particular, $\theta_{j,\mathbf{z}_{i}}^{k}$ stands for the potential
track built by associating the track $\theta_{j}^{k - 1}$ with the
measurement $\mathbf{z}_{i}(k)$, which is either virtual or real. We
recursively apply the association process for every set $\Gamma_{j}^{k}$
with $t = k,\cdots,k + d$, yielding the formation of the set of extended
and newly created putative tracks
$\Gamma^{k:k + d} = \lbrace \Gamma_{j}^{t} \rbrace_{t = k,\cdots,k + d}$.

When track segments up to time $k - 1$ are fixed to
$\Theta^{\star k - 1}$, the above maximization problem boils down to
selecting the subset of track segments
$\Theta^{\star k:k + d} \subset \Gamma^{k:k + d}$ that maximize the
partial cost function:

$$\widetilde{\mathcal{L}}\left( \Theta^{k:k + d} \right) = \prod_{t = k}^{k + d}{p\left( Z_{0}(t) \right)}\prod_{\theta_{j}^{k:k + d} \in \Theta^{k:k + d}}^{}\chi_{j}^{k:k + d}$$

where $\chi_{j}^{k:k + d} = \frac{\chi_{j}^{k + d}}{\chi_{j}^{k - 1}}$.

Now we formulate this maximization problem as a linear problem $P$. Let
$M = \left| \Theta^{k:k + d} \right| + \sum_{i = k}^{k + d}\left| Z_{0}(i) \right|$
that is the sum of number of potential tracks and the number of either
real or virtual measurements. Let
$N = \left| \Theta^{\star k - 1} \right| + \sum_{i = k}^{k + d}\left| Z_{0}(i) \right|$
be the sum of number of tracks already in $\Theta^{\star k - 1}$ and the
number of either real or virtual measurements. First construct a matrix
$A$ with size $M \times N$ such that each row represents a potential
track including extended tracks, newly created tracks, and dummy tracks.
Dummy tracks account for measurements which are not associated with any
tracks. While each column represents a measurement from frame $k - 1$ to
$k + d$. An example of matrix $A$ is given below which is constructed
from Fig. 2

Let's define a binary vector $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{M}$ such that
$\mathbf{b}(j) = 1$ if the $j$-th track is selected in the optimization
process, $0$ otherwise. Furthermore, define
$\mathbf{s} \in \mathbb{R}^{M}$ the cost vector with $\mathbf{s}(j)$ the
cost for the $j$-th track such that

$$s(j) = \left\{ \begin{array}{r}
\log\chi_{j}^{k:k + d}for\ track\ extension\ or\ creation \\
\log{P_{FD}\left( \mathbf{z}(t),t \right)}\ or\ 0\ for\ dummy\ track\ with\ real\ or\ virtual\ measurements \\
\end{array} \right.\ $$

Finally, we state the linear problem:

$$\mathbf{b}^{\star} = \arg{\max_{\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{N}}{\mathbf{b}^{T}\mathbf{s}}}$$

Subject to (A) linear equality constraints,

$$\mathcal{S = \{}\mathbf{b}^{T}A_{.j} = 1\ for\ j = 1,\cdots,M\}$$

\(B\) binary constraints:

$$\mathcal{B =}\lbrace \mathbf{b}(j) = 1\ or\ 0\ for\ j = 1,\cdots,N \rbrace$$
