## Definition of Trigonometry in Unit Circle

Recall the definitions of trigonometry in right-angle triangles are:

$$\sin\theta=\frac{o}{h}$$

$$\cos\theta=\frac{a}{h}$$

$$\tan\theta=\frac{o}{a}$$

These definitions are only valid for $0^{\circ}\le\theta\le 90\degree$. How can we extend these definitions for any angle $\theta$. Well, first let's draw a circle centered at the orgin with a unit radius (the so-called "unit circle"). In the diagram below, lable the origin as $O$. Draw an arbitary angle $\theta$ that makes with the positive $x$ axis and it will intersect the unit circle at $P$ with coordinate $(x,y)$. Then, draw a perpendicular line from $P$ onto the $x$ axis with foot $F$. In our construction, with analogue to the definitions of trigonometry in triangles, we define,

$$\sin\theta=\frac{y}{|OP|}=y$$

$$\cos\theta=\frac{x}{|OP|}=x$$

$$\tan\theta=\frac{y}{x}$$

These definitions are no longer restricted to $0\degree\le\theta\le 90\degree$.

## Rule of *ASCT*

Now let's have a look at how to calculate these trigonometry values in the rest quadrants besides the 1st quadrant. Refer to the dragram below, if $xOP_1$ has an angle of $\theta$, the

<iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/41jl3rqksa?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>

$$\angle{xOP_2}=\pi-\theta$$

$$\angle{xOP_3}=\pi+\theta$$

$$\angle{xOP_4}=2\pi-\theta$$

And if $P_1$ has coordinates $(x,y)$, the coordinates of $P_2,P_3,P_4$ are $(-x,y),(-x,-y),(x,-y)$. Then by definition of sine, we have

$$\sin\theta=y$$

$$\sin(\pi-\theta)=y$$

$$\sin(\pi+\theta)=-y$$

$$\sin(2\pi+\theta)=-y$$

Similarly, for cosine, we have

$$\cos\theta=x$$

$$\cos(\pi-\theta)=-x$$

$$\cos(\pi+\theta)=-x$$

$$\cos(2\pi+\theta)=x$$

And we have for tangent

$$\tan\theta=\frac{y}{x}$$

$$\tan(\pi-\theta)=-\frac{y}{x}$$

$$\tan(\pi+\theta)=\frac{y}{x}$$

$$\tan(2\pi+\theta)=-\frac{y}{x}$$

From these above results, we observe the following rules,

1. the absolute values of each trigonometry for $\theta,\pi-\theta,\pi+\theta,2\pi+\theta$ are exactly the same.
2. Secondly, in the first quadrant **A**ll trigonometry values are positive. In the second quadrant only **S**ine is positive. In the third quadrant, only **T**angent is positive while in the fourther quadrant, only **C**osine is positive. The observation is the well-known **ACST** rule.
3. Both sine and tangent are odd while cosine is even since
  
   $$\sin(-\theta)=\sin\left(2\pi-\theta\right)=-y=-\sin\theta$$
  
   $$\tan(-\theta)=\tan\left(2\pi-\theta\right)=-\frac{y}{x}=-\tan\theta$$
  
   $$\cos(-\theta)=\cos\left(2\pi-\theta\right)=x=\cos\theta$$

We can apply these rules to calculate the trigonometry values of any angle by relating it to a base angle in 1st quadrant. For example

$$\cos\left(\frac{2}{3}\pi\right)=\cos\left(\pi-\frac{1}{3}\pi\right)=-\cos\left(\frac{1}{3}\pi\right)=-\frac{1}{2}$$

## Other trigonometries

Besides since cosine and tangent, there are another 3 commonly used trigonometries. We define **sec**ant, **cosec**ant (or just **csc**) and **cot**angt as

$$\sec\theta=\frac{1}{\cos\theta}$$

$$\csc\theta=\frac{1}{\sin\theta}$$

$$\cot\theta=\frac{1}{\tan\theta}$$

## Identities

We have already seen some of the identites in the previous section, for example

$$\sin\left(\theta-\pi\right)=\sin(\theta)$$

We can add on some more identities by notating that sine and cosine are both periodic with a period $2\pi$ while tangent with a period of $\pi$. For example, the following identity is true

$$\sin\left(3\pi-\theta\right)=\sin\theta$$

Recall that in terms of right-angle triangles, we learned the following trigonometry identites with supplyment angles

$$\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta\right)=\cos\theta$$

$$\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta\right)=\sin\theta$$

By dividing these two equations, we also have

$$\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta\right)=\cot\theta$$

$$\cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta\right)=\tan\theta$$

Are these two identites still valid when we take an arbitary angle $\theta$? The answer is yes. But how do we prove it? The simple way is to use the fact that if $P$ has coorindates $(x,y)$ and $\angle{xOP}=\theta$, the image of reflection $P^\prime$ over the line with angle $\frac{\pi}{4}$ has coordinates $(y,x)$.

### Pythagoras Identity

From the definitions of sine and consine in unit circle in terms of the coordinates $(x,y)$ of $P$, it is easy to see that

$$\sin^2(\theta)+\cos^2(\theta)=x^2+y^2=|OP|^2=1$$

There are another two related identities to this. Consider dividing the above equations by $\cos^2(\theta)$ or by $\sin^2(\theta)$, we have

$$\tan^2(\theta)+1=\sec^2(\theta)$$

$$1+\cot^2(\theta)=\csc^2(\theta)$$

### Compound Angle Formulas

Next, let's consider how to calculate the trigonometric ratios of the summation or differece between two angles $A,B$. These formulas are knowns as the compound angle formulas

$$\sin(A\pm B)=\sin(A)\cos(B)\pm \cos(A)\sin(B)$$

$$\cos(A\pm B)=\cos(A)\cos(B)\mp \sin(A)\sin(B)$$

The ratio of the above two equations give us

$$\tan(A\pm B)=\frac{\tan(A)\pm\tan(B)}{1\mp \tan(A)\tan(B)}$$

It is sufficient to prove these formula for $0\le A,B\le\frac{\pi}{2}$ (why?). Follow the steps in the applet below for details

### Double Angle and Half Angle Formulas

If we let $A=B$ for the summation compound angle formula, we get the double angle formulas

$$\sin(2A)=2\sin(A)\cos(A)$$

$$\cos(2A)=\cos^2A-\sin^2A=2\cos^2(A)-1=1-2\sin^2(A)$$

$$\tan(2A)=\frac{2\tan A}{1-\tan^2A}$$

Notice that we have used the identity $\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A=1$ to reach the second and third equalities from the first in the double angle formula of sine. Half angle formulas are maily based on the double angle formula of cosine.

$$\sin^2A=\frac{1-\cos(2A)}{2}$$

$$\cos^2A=\frac{1+\cos(2A)}{2}$$

$$\tan^2A=\frac{1-\cos(2A)}{1+\cos(2A)}$$

## Graph of Trigonometric Functions and Their Inverses

$$f(x)=\sin x$$

$$f(x)=\cos x$$

$$f(x)=\tan x$$

Based on the graph of $f(x)$, we can draw the graph of

$$\frac{1}{f(x)}=\csc x$$

$$\frac{1}{f(x)}=\sec x$$

$$\frac{1}{f(x)}=\cot x$$

How do we define the inverse function of sine, cosine or tangent if they are not one-to-one functions? We can achieve this by restricting the domains. Next, let's draw the graph of these inverse

$$f^{-1}(x)=\sin^{-1}x=\arcsin x$$

$$f^{-1}(x)=\cos^{-1}x=\arccos x$$

$$f^{-1}(x)=\tan^{-1}x=\arctan x$$

Can you use similar strategies to workout the definitions and graphs of the following functions

$$f^{-1}(x)=\csc^{-1} x$$

$$f^{-1}(x)=\sec^{-1} x$$

$$f^{-1}(x)=\cot^{-1} x$$

## Extension

1. Modulus-argument forme of complex numbers is $z=r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)$.
2. Multiple angle formula can be derived from de Moire's theorem
  
   $$\sin(n\theta)=\cdots$$
  
   $$\cos(n\theta)=\cdots$$
  
   $$\sin^n(\theta)=\cdots$$
  
   $$\cos^n(\theta)=\cdots$$
3. Integration of trigonometric functions
  
   $$\int \sin^2x dx$$
  
   $$\int \cos^2x dx$$
  
   $$\cdots$$
